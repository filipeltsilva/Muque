# Muque
A boilerplate for front-end projects.

## How Muque works
Muque uses Gulp as the task manager and Bower to manage the front-end dependencies.

Muque has tasks to development environments (tasks finished in *:dev*) and tasks directioned to production environments (tasks finised in *:dist*).

Muque also has some auxiliar tasks to help the developer/team.
